# Life cycle
i tried to cover the full life cycle of the crowdfunding
## a student registers and applies to a crowdfund
the university can approve or refuse the request
the admin views the university approved request and can approve it
the anonymousDonor views the approved crowdfunds

The app uses authentication and needs to use authorization

## the front end
shows the auth & the approved crowdfunds
